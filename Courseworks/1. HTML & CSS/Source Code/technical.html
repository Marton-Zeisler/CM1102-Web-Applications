<p class="body_text">Originally, Python was written in the C programming langauge. When CPython was first released in 1989, C was a very a popular language already and it was widely used. It's important to understand how the interpreter works in Python. The word "interpreter" can be used in many different ways when we're talking about Python. Sometimes interpreter refers to the Python REPL, the extremely poweful interactive prompt you get by typing python at the command line. Sometimes people use "the Python interpreter" more or less interchangeably with "Python" to talk about executing Python code from start to finish. But in simple terms, it simply means that it's the last step in the process of executing a Python program.
<br /><br />
Before the interpreter takes over, Python performs three other steps: lexing, parsing, and compiling. Together, these three steps transform the programmer's source code from lines of text into structured code objects containing instructions that the interpreter can understand. The interpreter's job is to take these code objects and follow the instructions.

<br /><br />
It's also important to mention that Python has a lot of built-in functions and types that make it very easy to work with. The table below highlights some of the built-in types in the modern Python langauge: </p>
